                    My love for video games came from observing my father playing.
                    When I was just a child every day I would wait for my father to come back from work to watch him play. 
                    Games gave me many things: from unforgettable experiences and emotions to knowledge and skills. Those things motivated me to become a game designer, I want to design experiences, share knowledge and teach people through games.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But I fully understand that dream alone is not enough to become a game designer.
                    So, I was developing many different skills connected to understanding the game development process from 3D modeling and sound design to scripting.
                    Still, I don't see an end to things I can learn, so I will continue to grow and evolve both as a personality and a designer.

                    In general, I like talking to people, helping them, and meeting new ones.
                    And I always enjoy a good joke.

                    When it comes to games, I'm open to all kinds of games, because eveyone of them can surprise you with interesting game play, engaiging story or both at the same time. 
                    But I think there are games that will always stay in your memory no matter the time.
                    For me these games are Deus Ex: Human Revolution, Cyberpunk 2077 and Disco Elysium. All of them have a perfect combination of gameplay and stories which result in unforgettable experience, that will always be with you.
